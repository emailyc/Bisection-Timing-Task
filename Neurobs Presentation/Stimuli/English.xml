    <item key="Instructions">In this experiment, we are interested in how well you can judge the duration of a sound.

A series of tones will be presented. Your task is to judge whether the stimulus duration is closer the SHORT  or LONG target duration. 

This experiment will start by familiarizing you with the SHORT and LONG target durations first, followed by practice session and test session. 

Only practice and test session require you to make responses.

Please refrain from counting or foot-tapping. It is very important to remember duration by heart.

Press SPACE to begin the study session when you are ready.</item>
